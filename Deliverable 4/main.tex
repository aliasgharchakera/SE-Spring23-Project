\section*{Introduction}

Thekedaar hatao is an application that aims to ease the process of building
your dream home. It provides the users with features that makes the building
process smoother and easier overall for the user of the application. The
calculator on the application, will provide you with an estimated amount of
cement, cinder blocks, sand, and other such raw materials that are essential
while building your house. In addition, the application will help cater the
dreamers by having a forum where people can communicate about the problems that
have arisen and how they tackled them. Advice threads and asking for help will
be carried out on the forum. Since you can never be sure of how much material
you exactly need, there is always a (+ or -)5\% chance of having extra
material, you can also sell this to other users on the app through a buy and
sell section. For individuals wanting to have a communication privately, the
application will also provide an opportunity to privately chat with someone
registered on the application.
